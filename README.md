# Generating Graphical Representations of Sample Data in Rainfall.txt
This repository involves programs that experiment on APIs with Flask and generating graphs from data for analytics using the Dash by Plotly module. Rainfall.txt is a sample file which contains the information used for the demonstrations.

- Flask API.py is just practice with the FLask module and returns the respective information in the rainfall.txt file that was searched for.
- Dash Bar Graph.py is a barplot representation of the data in the rainfall file
- Dash Scatter Plot is a scattter plot representation of the data in the sample file
- APIxDash.py is an integration of the API created with Flask and the representations created with Dash
